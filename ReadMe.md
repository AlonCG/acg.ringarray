My second experimental/experiential git repo playing with concepts I've neglected in recent years.

Hello folks. I doubt there is anything useful in this repo, I am still attempting to learn how to use git actions along with XUnit test fixtures. If you find anything useful, please feel free to use it. I am aware that there are some code optimizations that can be made, that is not yet the purpose of this repo. In the future I may address performace issues .

A few things attempted:
- considered the "metal" of a generic iterator
- added XUnit tests (need to play with more cases)
- Used the code coverage tools available to Visual Studio.

As usual ... comments and criticism are welcome.
